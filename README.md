Problem Domain: Finance/Entertainment

Description: We are making an engaging and educational stock trading game that allows players to test their knowledge 
and skills in the world of finance and investing. There will be two or more prompts on which financial investment 
should a player choose. Players will then choose and by the end of the game, players can compare their earnings and
losses.

A list of any technical problems blocking progress: 
- Difficulty in searching through data to obtain specific information needed such as the exchange rate in a specific time
